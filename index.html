								<p>If you asked me for my elevator pitch, I'd say I am a highly creative and science-minded professional with an education in human behavior and technology interaction. Leveraged with a research-emphasis, my brand style is driven by impact mitigation, timeless design, user-centric accessibilty, and purpose-driven visual identity that creates beatuiful experiences.</a>.</p>
								<p>I am obsessed with immersing myself in a user's journey to fully empathize with not only how I can serve an audience, but why I should. This practice blends my neuropsychology research background with design to translate subject matter into sleek and efficient end-products for a range of marketing, promotion, and utility needs without losing sight of the guiding purpose. I excel within creative environments built on direct communications to build excellent rapport with clients and peers. I am also deeply passionate about participating in meaningful and humanitarian-centered work where possible.  </p>

								<h3>Grow + Gather</h3>
								<p><a href="www.growgather.com">Grow + Gather</a> is an urban farm, restaurant, and marketplace in Englewood, CO. With a desire to serve the community and bring the heritage as well as the growth of Englewood together, branding for Grow + Gather centers around approachable and community-oriented messaging paired with a sophisticated but sincere take on agriculture.</p>
								<h4>Website Re-design</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2021-01-22 at 4.28.33 PM.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>While Grow + Gather is the overachring farming operation and the space itself, The Feedery brand represents the restaurant and market. These two brands, while relying on each other, caused inital confusion as they lacked differentiation and consistency. This sparked a website redesign at growgather.com that provided the information most sought after when users arrived at the site. The information set on the landing page was determined by user interactions gathered from Google Analytics.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2021-01-22 at 4.41.28 PM.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I also worked to create consistency petween pages on growgather.com and developed a tab system to create a more streamlined user experience while showcasing unique aspects of the comapny, such as the onsite farms and event spaces, two parts of the business that attract different users to the site.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2021-01-22 at 4.41.45 PM.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>Packaging</h4>
								<p>Designing at the speed of nature has been a beautiful challenge - as honey arrives from the bees, there becomes a need for jar labels. As lettuce grows and the kitchen has extra product to make syrups and preserves, new branding needs are born. Here are some of these creations - from development to product launch, marketing, and promotion, I have created and maintained each project myself.</p>

								<h3>Babcia's Bread</h3>
								<p>As a one-woman owned cottage-industry business, the message behind this brand was inpsired by my interactions with the owner who is a vibrant story-teller, a spiritual and charity-driven individual with an outspoken pride of her Polish heritage. All design decisions were made with future ease of maintenance in mind - with no staff or brand manager, she would need to easily source additional packaging, create website edits, and develop new materials once I finished my contract with her.</p>
								<h4>The Original Label</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/sticker 4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>Re-designed Brand</h4>

								<h4>Babcia's Bread Brand Guidelines</h4>
								<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c90rCYwpBlIYEqRHtMlUvBZwr8mJurY4/preview" width="480" height="360"></iframe>
								<p>We spent a lot of time working on her brand message. She enjoyed having control over the writing, tone of voice, and mission statement but lacked the clarity of what it means to turn a purpose into a message. I asked her to describe what came to mind when I said four statements: 1) Our mission, 2) Our promise, 3) Our essence, 4) Our mantra. This helped to get her brain thinking in terms of relevant messaging without having had experience with this before.</p>

								<h3> EngleFood </h3>
								<p>In the midst of covid, restaurants in Englewood were struggling. Many lacked a digital prescense, let alone someone to help them promote their offerings, build a website with SEO in mind, or create a Google presence. EngleFood was born with the idea of bridging customers to the restaurants who need them most. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2021-01-22 at 5.41.33 PM.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p> Serving as an Englewood-specific restaurant/bar discovery platform, this site needed to serve three users. First, The Merchant, or the business that would list their offerings. This site needed to be unbiased, providing equal opportunity to all restaurants and bars while also providing strategic SEO and opportunites for customers to reach out to them. Second, The Consumer, or the local customer who might be visiting the site to see what restaurants existed or to find a favorite they already have in mind. Last, The Sponsor, or the non-food and beverage business that would benefit from listing their logo on the site to gain awareness of their brand.</p>
								<h4>The Filtering System</h4>
								<p>I developed this filtering system based on competitor analysis and some informal user surveys during the development phase. These filters automatically shuffle the available restaurants so a different business can be listed at the top each time a user enters the site. These were designed for ease of use on desktop and mobile as well as designed to be relevant during the pandemic, including filter options such as outdoor seating or delivery.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/RPReplay_Final1611362839.mov" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>The Restaurant Sign Up</h4>
								<p>With a small budget and a team of two, the sign up form serves to gather enough information to get a restaurant listed while being quick enough that it doesn't serve as a barrier to sign up.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/RPReplay_Final1611362928.mov" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>The Sponsorship Page</h4>
								<p>Without sponsorship, there could be no marketing budget. Luckily there was enough interest in sponsoring, that an online payment system was necessary and an easy way to gain a revenue stream. The most fun part: making the sponsorship avatars.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/RPReplay_Final1611363004.MP4" alt="" /></span>

								<h3>Personal Projects</h3>
								<p>Here are personal projects that I've done to hone my skills.</p>
								<h4>Class Sign Up Interface Prototype</h4>
								<p>The most inefficient part of college was the class sign up, especially at a large state college where there was little guidance about your four-year plan, something like this would have been amazing. Designed on Sketch and prototyped via Principle.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Class+Sign+Up.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>Credit Card Checkout</h4>
								<p>Here I played with Toggle Tokens instead of dropdown or check boxes for shipping prices. I feel that Toggle Tokens are easier to use for folks with mobility issues. This was designed on Sketch and prototyped with Principle. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Credit+Card+Checkout.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>Biophilia</h4>
								<p>A research-based app concnept designed to gamify the exploration of urban green space and heal the nature deficit in society. Designed on Sketch. For the full explanation of my process, visit my <a href="https://kirbypeterman.squarespace.com/biophilia">old portfolio site.</a></p>
